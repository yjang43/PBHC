# Motion Filter Implementation

The motion filter implementation is adapted from the official [IPMAN](https://github.com/sha2nkt/ipman-r) codebase, so please refer to its installation process.

## Demo

```
python utils/motion_filter.py --folder <path_to_motions> --convert_rot True
```
- If motions are y-up, set `--convert_rot False`
